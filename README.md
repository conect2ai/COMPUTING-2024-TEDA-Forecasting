# 1. Abstract/Overview

The expansion of smart systems and the Internet of Things (IoT) has increased data generation, demanding efficient real-time processing techniques. In this scenario, edge computing and TinyML, which allow the execution of machine learning models on low-power microcontrollers, emerge as promising solutions. However, there are still challenges in developing lightweight algorithms capable of processing continuous data streams on devices with limited resources. In this article, we propose TEDA-Forecasting, a time series forecasting algorithm based on the Typicality and Eccentricity Data Analytics (TEDA) technique, designed to operate on TinyML platforms. To validate this innovative algorithm, we consider different types of input data, as well as its actual embedding on a real-world edge device for more practical evaluation, efficiently enabling anomaly detection and outlier correction in the input streams. The achieved results indicate that TEDA-Forecasting offers high accuracy with energy efficiency, demonstrating its potential for applications in resource-constrained IoT systems, such as those enabled by the emerging TinyML paradigm.
  
For a better didactic exposition, the results will be presented in 9 notebooks:

# 2. Environment Setup
First, start by cloning the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/conect2ai/COMPUTING-2024-TEDA-Forecasting.git
```

We also have cloned the `Padasip` repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/matousc89/padasip
```
It is possible to install using `pip`:
```bash
!pip3 install padasip
```
- The **Padasip** (*Python Adaptive Signal Processing*) is a library designed to simplify adaptive signal processing tasks within Python (filtering, prediction, reconstruction, classification). More information [here](https://matousc89.github.io/padasip/).  :twisted_rightwards_arrows:

Now, we are going to install the  `WandB`: üíª

```bash
!pip3 install wandb -qU
```
 - If you want to know more about software package **WandB**, click [here](https://wandb.ai/site).  :bar_chart:
 
## 2.1 How to run on Freematics One+

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) (VSCode Extension)
3. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/conect2ai/ELSEVIER-2024-TEDA-Forecasting.git
```

4. Open the project folder `./Freematics/firmware_v5/telelogger` on PlatformIO, as illustrated in the figure below.
